The Sea Around Us allocation process use the taxonomic identity of the catch (after the disaggregation process) to allocate catch to the system of spatial cells based on taxonomic distributions (Close and others 2004). Also used is information about fishing access and fishing patterns of reporting countries (where possible after the effects of reflagging are removed) (Watson and others 2004). Maps of catches by all gear types annually since 1950 are also available. The catch data is associated with likely associated fishing gear types based on reported associations by fishing year, fishing country and landed taxa (Watson and others 2006a, 2006b).
