Each sample was sorted at 6-12x magnification under a Wild M-5 dissecting microscope, and plastic particles removed for further analysis. Plastic particles were soaked in deionized water to remove salts, dried at 60\u00b0C, and stored in a desiccator. Dry mass was measured on an analytical balance. Particles were then digitally imaged with a Zooscan digital scanner (Gorsky et al. 2010). The total number of particles was measured using NIH ImageJ-based tools in the Zooprocess software, calibrated against manual measurements (Gilfillan et al. 2009, Gorsky et al. 2010).

These export flux estimates are used in conjunction with published empirical relationships to predict changes in benthic biomass. The polar oceans and some upwelling areas may experience increases in benthic biomass, but most other regions show decreases, with up to 38% reductions in parts of the northeast Atlantic. Our analysis projects a future ocean with smaller sized infaunal benthos, potentially reducing energy transfer rates though benthic multicellular food webs. More than 80% of potential deep-water biodiversity hotspots known around the world, including canyons, seamounts and cold-water coral reefs, are projected to experience negative changes in biomass.

Our projections use multi-model mean export flux estimates from eight fully-coupled earth system models, which contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, that have been forced by high representative concentration pathways (RCP8.5). These export flux estimates are used in conjunction with published empirical relationships to predict changes in benthic biomass. The polar oceans and some upwelling areas may experience increases in benthic biomass, but most other regions show decreases, with up to 38% reductions in parts of the northeast Atlantic. Our analysis projects a future ocean with smaller sized infaunal benthos, potentially reducing energy transfer rates though benthic multicellular food webs. More than 80% of potential deep-water biodiversity hotspots known around the world, including canyons, seamounts and cold-water coral reefs, are projected to experience negative changes in biomass.
