This Promotion of Access to Information Act, Act 2 of 2000 (PAIA) stipulates, in summary, that \u201c\u2026 access to information will be granted once certain requirements have been met. The Act also recognises that the right of access to information may be limited if the limitations are reasonable in an open and democratic society (e.g. a limitation that protects privacy). This Act applies to all records held by public (i.e. State) or private bodies (or their contractors). All public bodies have a duty to appoint staff (called information officers) to handle requests for access to information. As long as a request for information does not conflict with another law, access to most information held by a public body must be granted, regardless of the reason for the request. (A public body is defined in the Act as any State institution or administration in the national or provincial sphere and any municipality in the local sphere.) Information officers must, however, withhold records if relevant fees have not been paid by the requester.\u201d<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cA request for access must be made on a prescribed form, giving precise details on which records are required and the identity, language preference and contact details of the person requesting access to them. If there is a fee for the record, this will have to be paid before the request is processed. Requests can also be made orally. Information officers must respond within 30 days of the request being made, but can extend the period to 60 days if there is a large number of applications or the request requires a search for records in another city.\u201d<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cInformation officers must respond to queries within 60 days.\u201d<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cSubject to availability, information must be made available in the form (e.g. written and audiovisual transcripts) and language of the requester's choice. \u201c<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cInformation officers have a duty to respond to these requests and to also transfer any requests to other public bodies that hold relevant information. Priority must be given to transferred requests.\u201d<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cThe information officer must inform the requester (in writing) if the record cannot be found, and must also give a full account of the steps taken to try to access the record. If the record is subsequently recovered, then access must be granted.\u201d<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cIf information requested is due to be published within 90 days of the request, the information officer can defer giving access to it, but must notify the person in writing of the period for which access is to be deferred. However, if the deferral will result in the requester suffering substantial prejudice, then access must be granted.\u201d<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cIf a request for information relates to a third party, the information officer must take all reasonable steps to inform the person concerned as soon as possible (within 21 days if possible). They may reveal the name of the person asking for information to the third party. If the information officer believes that the information might be protected in terms of this Act, he or she must tell the third party and explain the law to them.\u201d<br\/><br \/>\n\u201cIf the third party does not consent to the request for access to information about them, they may ask that it remain undisclosed, but they must do so within 21 days of being informed of the request.\u201d <br\/><br \/>\n\u201cThe information officer will consider the request for access to information in light of the third party's representation.
