    <br/> The Open Ocean and Large Marine Ecosystems components of the TWAP project were leaded by UNESCO-IOC. UNESCO-IOC contributed to the EC-FP7 project GEOWOW by providing Ocean Essential Variables to GEOSS Common Infrastructure and by developping cloud-computing based services to process CMIP5 future projections based on IPCC scenarios. In addition, marine biodiversity baseline indicators are provided by the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), a global project under the auspices of the International Oceanographic Data and information Exchange (IODE) programme of UNESCO-IOC. The GEOWOW database and web servers are hosted at the IOC Project office for IODE in Oostende (Belgium).

      NOAA is an agency that enriches life through science. Its reach goes from the surface of the sun to the depths of the ocean floor as the agency works to keep citizens informed of the changing environment around them.  Since 1983, NOAA has supported the LME approach to the assessment and management of coastal ocean goods and services.  The LME Program office has been providing developing countries with scientific and technological assistance to the GEF-funded LME projects around the globe.

    The International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) is an international network of over 10,000 scientists in 70 countries investigating the causes and consequences of global environmental change (www.IGBP.net).  IGBP promotes international research collaboration on global-scale and regional-scale interactions between Earth's biological, chemical and physical processes and their interactions with human systems.  The overall vision of IGBP is to provide essential scientific leadership and knowledge of the Earth system to help guide society onto a sustainable pathway during rapid global change. For the TWAP LMEs component, IGBP carried out the assessment of nutrient inputs to LMEs from river basins.

      <p>The Global Alliance of Continuous Plankton Recorders (GACS) was established in 2011 with the aim of understanding changes in plankton biodiversity at ocean basin scales through a global network of CPR surveys. It is hosted by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation of Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates the initial and longest running CPR survey. Their role was to provide data on the zooplankton from GACS-CPR data, as the most synoptic, consistently collected view of global zooplankton populations, their current status and trends, where possible. Further information can be obtained from Sonia Batten.</p>

      <p>The Center for Marine Assessment and Planning (CMAP) aims to find effective and efficient ways to sustainably use and protect our marine ecosystems. CMAP's overarching mission is to 1) facilitate interdisciplinary work that bridges undergraduate to faculty-level research, 2) engage resource users and management practitioners in the pursuit of science-based solutions, and 3) address local, national, and international issues. Within the TWAP project, CMAP developed and applied Cumulative Human Impact and Ocean Health Index assessments to LMEs and Open Ocean regions.</p>

  <p>His to LME component is primarily in assessing ocean climate change, which is represented by sea surface temperature (SST). By analyzing regional variability of global SST data, I was able to identify those LMEs that warmed most rapidly, up to 10 times faster than the World Ocean mean SST. His most recent assessment (2014) has revealed a significant slowdown - and even a reversal - of the previous warming, in many LMEs. </p>

Previously she was a postdoctoral research fellow for the Sea Around Us project at the Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia, working on the Ocean Health Index Food Provisioning models. Her research interests include measuring the effects of fishing on marine resources, the development and testing of global data-poor stock assessment techniques and indicators of ecosystem health. Her past work included the development of geospatial techniques for assessing highly migratory fish stocks and the assessment of suitable areas for temporal–spatial fishing area closures for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico.

  <p>Maciej works at the International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project coordinating a wide range of IOCCP activities that focus on observations in marine biogeochemistry. He focuses mainly on marine biogeochemical cycling with special interest in the surface ocean – lower atmosphere fluxes, combining satellite and reanalysis data with in situ measurements in order to parameterize climate related surface and subsurface biogeochemical properties. In the past he worked in the UK, Japan and France designing and conducting field campaigns (TA, DIC and pCO<sub>2</sub> measurements along the hydrographic sections) and generating basin-wide to global mapping of investigated parameters using neural statistics, self-organizing maps and other computational methods.</p>

    <p>Dr. van Hooidonk is a assistant scientist with the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) a research institute of the University of Miami working at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. His work focusses on the effects of climate change, both ocean acidification and temperature change on coral reef ecosystems world wide. To project future impacts on coral reefs he extensively uses Global Circulation Models, regional ocean models and high resolution satellite data. For this study, van Hooidonk provided the ocean acidification projections derived from an ensemble of GCMs used in the IPCC’s fifth assessment report.</p>
